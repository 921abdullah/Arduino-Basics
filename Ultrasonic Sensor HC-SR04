//HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor which is used to calculate distance of an object from the sensor using sonar, it can accurately detect objects upto 4 meters(13 feet)
//This sensor consists oof 4 pins in total namely, VCC, trig, echo and GND.
//This sensor can be mounted and used for making robotics projects as well as in other applications where there is such a requirement.

//Variables specifying pin numbers of arduino associated with trig and echo pins of the sensor.
const int trig = 8;
const int echo = 9;
//delay variable
int wait = 10;
//variables for calculting time and distance
long distance;
int time;

void setup() {
  // trig pin is output pin as it emits ultrasonic waves from the sensor.
  pinMode(trig, OUTPUT);
  // echo pin is input pin as it detects ultrasonic waves which are bounced back towards the sensor.
  pinMode(echo, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // make sure trig is low at first to avoid previous data from intefering
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  delay(wait);
  
  //make the pin HIGH and emit pulse for 10 microseconds by adding delay , since this is the time it takes for the senosr to emit full 8 cycle sonicburst.
  digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);
  delay(wait);
  
  //bring the pin back to low state to ensure a single reading is made at a time.
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  
  // pulseIn function is used to calculate time traveled by the sound wave with the help of echo pin, it has two parameters, the second parameter can be both HIGH/LOW
  // In this case we want second parameter to be HIGH since it needs to be made HIGH when the sound waves reach the sensor after bouncing back and remain high till
  // all of the sound wave has reached the sensor, in which case it will go LOW again
  time = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
  
  //the actual distance of obstacle from the sensor will be half of distance travelled by sound wave
  //speed of sound is 0.034 cm/microsecond
  // s = (t * v)/2
